Our average delivery time with this method is 1.8 days. The arrival date is not guaranteed, however 95% of our customers receive their order within 2 business days. Some customers (especially those in rural areas) may experience longer delivery times and may receive their order after 2-3 business days. If you select a faster or slower shipping method, then the estimated arrival date will no longer apply. Our items ship from multiple warehouses all across the USA. We can ship same-day from some locations (particularly on the west coast) as late as 9pm Eastern. However, we cannot guarantee from which location your order will ship. Therefore, we can only be sure your item will ship same day by the earliest cutoff of 4:30pm Eastern. Therefore, if you are on the site between 4 and 5pm Eastern (or visit in the morning and then come back in the evening) you may notice our estimated arrival date increase by one business day after 4:30pm Eastern. This is a conservative estimate and your order may ship same-day, even when ordering after this time (up to as late as 9pm Eastern)."
